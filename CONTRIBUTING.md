We want people to join in the project! Joining in with the project will make everything better.

## Submitting Issues
When creating an issue for the project, please ensure you let us know
- What the problem you encountered was
- How you caused it to happen (preferably steps that will cause the issue reliably every time)
- What your expectations are that should happen

## Submitting a Pull Request
We're sure your code is super-awesome, but we want to make sure it fits in with the whole project so we're all able to maintain it.
- Your code needs to fit with our whole code style. We know we're all individuals but we really want to have a uniform style. (Maybe it's all automatedâ€¦)
- Make sure you have tests which exercise your changes
- Make sure you've documented what you're changing in the pull request so we know what will happen when we merge your changes
